Description: An easy way to get started with Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) in R. The GAN algorithm was initially 
    described by Goodfellow et al. 2014 <https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2014/file/5ca3e9b122f61f8f06494c97b1afccf3-Paper.pdf>. A GAN can be used to learn the joint distribution of complex data by 
    comparison. A GAN consists of two neural networks a Generator and a Discriminator, where the two
    neural networks play an adversarial minimax game.
    Built-in GAN models make the training of GANs in R possible in one line and make it easy to 
    experiment with different design choices (e.g. different network architectures, value functions, optimizers).
    The built-in GAN models work with tabular data (e.g. to produce synthetic data) and image data. 
    Methods to post-process the output of GAN models to enhance the quality of samples are available.
