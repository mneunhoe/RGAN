## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Updated the DESCRIPTION text. It now is a full paragraph including a reference to the original GAN paper. 
* Wrote TRUE and FALSE instead of T and F in all places.
* Added examples to the main functions.
* Made sure that user plot options are reset with a call of on.exit().


## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

2 NOTEs:
  
* Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION:
    GAN (2:37, 10:75, 10:90, 11:136, 12:19, 14:14, 16:18, 17:43)
    GANs (14:46)
    al (11:32)
    et (11:29)
    Goodfellow (11:18)
    optimizers (15:102)
    
GAN and GANs are common abbreviations of Generative Adversarial Network(s).
et al. is a common abbreviation for multiple authors on a paper.
