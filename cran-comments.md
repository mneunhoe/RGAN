## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Updated the DESCRIPTION text. It now is a full paragraph including a reference to the original GAN paper. 
* Wrote TRUE and FALSE instead of T and F in all places.
* Added examples to the main functions.
* Made sure that user plot options are reset with a call of on.exit().


## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs or NOTEs
