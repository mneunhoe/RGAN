\title{Compute Discriminator Scores from Checkpointed Discriminators}
\usage{
compute_discriminator_scores(
  trained_gan,
  generated_samples,
  real_data,
  batch_size = 1000,
  device = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{trained_gan}{A trained GAN object of class "trained_RGAN" with checkpoints}

\item{generated_samples}{A matrix of generated samples (N_samples x data_dim)}

\item{real_data}{A matrix of real data for computing real scores}

\item{batch_size}{Batch size for scoring (to manage memory). Defaults to 1000.}

\item{device}{Device for computation ("cpu", "cuda", "mps"). Defaults to trained_gan's device.}
}
\value{
A list with:
\itemize{
\item d_score_fake: Matrix of discriminator scores (N_discriminators x N_samples)
\item d_score_real: Vector of mean discriminator scores on real data (length N_discriminators)
\item epochs: Vector of epoch numbers corresponding to each discriminator
}
}
\description{
Evaluates generated samples using multiple discriminator checkpoints
to create the discriminator score matrix required for post-GAN boosting.
