\title{Gradient Penalty for WGAN-GP}
\usage{
gradient_penalty(d_net, real_data, fake_data, device = "cpu")
}
\arguments{
\item{d_net}{The discriminator network (torch::nn_module)}

\item{real_data}{Real data samples (torch_tensor)}

\item{fake_data}{Generated fake data samples (torch_tensor)}

\item{device}{The device to use ("cpu", "cuda", or "mps")}
}
\value{
The gradient penalty loss (torch_tensor)
}
\description{
Computes the gradient penalty for WGAN-GP training as described in
Gulrajani et al. (2017) "Improved Training of Wasserstein GANs".
The gradient penalty enforces the Lipschitz constraint on the discriminator
by penalizing gradients that deviate from norm 1 on interpolated samples.
