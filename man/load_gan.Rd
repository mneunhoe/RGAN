\title{Load a Trained GAN}
\usage{
load_gan(path, device = "cpu")
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{The base file path to the saved model (without extension, same as used in save_gan)}

\item{device}{The device to load the model onto ("cpu", "cuda", or "mps").
Defaults to "cpu". Use this to move a model trained on GPU to CPU or vice versa.}
}
\value{
A trained GAN object of class "trained_RGAN" that can be used with
\code{\link{sample_synthetic_data}} or passed to \code{\link{gan_trainer}}
for continued training.
}
\description{
Loads a trained GAN model that was previously saved using
\code{\link{save_gan}}. The loaded model can be used for sampling
synthetic data or continued training.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Load a previously saved GAN
loaded_gan <- load_gan("my_gan_model")

# Use it to generate synthetic data
transformer <- data_transformer$new()
# (fit transformer to original data or load it separately)
synthetic_data <- sample_synthetic_data(loaded_gan, transformer, n_samples = 100)

# Or continue training
continued_gan <- gan_trainer(
  transformed_data,
  generator = loaded_gan$generator,
  discriminator = loaded_gan$discriminator,
  generator_optimizer = loaded_gan$generator_optimizer,
  discriminator_optimizer = loaded_gan$discriminator_optimizer,
  epochs = 50
)
}
