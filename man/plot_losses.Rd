\title{Plot GAN Training Losses}
\usage{
plot_losses(trained_gan, smooth = 0, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{trained_gan}{A trained GAN object of class "trained_RGAN" with tracked losses}

\item{smooth}{Smoothing factor for the loss curves (0 = no smoothing, higher = more smoothing).
Uses exponential moving average. Defaults to 0.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to plot()}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns NULL. Called for side effect of producing a plot.
}
\description{
Plots the generator and discriminator loss curves from GAN training.
Requires the GAN to have been trained with \code{track_loss = TRUE}.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
data <- sample_toydata()
transformer <- data_transformer$new()
transformer$fit(data)
transformed_data <- transformer$transform(data)
trained_gan <- gan_trainer(transformed_data, epochs = 50, track_loss = TRUE)
plot_losses(trained_gan)
plot_losses(trained_gan, smooth = 0.9)  # With smoothing
}
