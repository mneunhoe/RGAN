\arguments{
\item{d_score_fake}{Matrix of discriminator scores on fake samples (N_discriminators x N_samples).
Each row contains scores from one discriminator checkpoint for all candidate samples.}

\item{d_score_real}{Vector of mean discriminator scores on real data (length N_discriminators).}

\item{B}{Matrix of candidate synthetic samples (N_samples x data_dim).}

\item{real_N}{Number of real training samples (used for privacy calibration).}

\item{steps}{Number of boosting iterations. Defaults to 400.}

\item{N_generators}{Number of discriminator checkpoints used. Defaults to 200.}

\item{uniform_init}{Initialize phi with uniform distribution. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{dp}{Use differential privacy for discriminator selection via exponential mechanism.
Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{MW_epsilon}{Total privacy budget for multiplicative weights (only if dp=TRUE).
Defaults to 0.1.}

\item{weighted_average}{Use weighted averaging (weights proportional to sqrt(step)).
Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{averaging_window}{Number of final steps to average over. Defaults to NULL (all steps).}
}
\value{
A list with:
\itemize{
\item PGB_sample: Matrix of selected high-quality samples
\item d_score_PGB: Discriminator scores for selected samples
}
}
\description{
Implements the Post-GAN Boosting algorithm from Neunhoeffer et al. (2021)
"Private Post-GAN Boosting" (ICLR 2021). This algorithm improves the quality of GAN
samples by learning a distribution over candidate samples that fools an ensemble of
discriminators using multiplicative weights.

# Typically called via apply_post_gan_boosting(), but can be used directly:
result <- post_gan_boosting(
  d_score_fake = discriminator_scores_matrix,
  d_score_real = real_scores_vector,
  B = candidate_samples,
  real_N = 10000,
  steps = 200
)
boosted_samples <- result$PGB_sample
