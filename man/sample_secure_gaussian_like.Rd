\title{Sample Secure Gaussian Noise using OpenDP}
\usage{
sample_secure_gaussian_like(tensor, scale)
}
\arguments{
\item{tensor}{A torch tensor whose shape to match}

\item{scale}{Standard deviation of the Gaussian noise}
}
\value{
A torch tensor of noise with the same shape and device as input
}
\description{
Generate Gaussian noise with the same shape as a tensor using
OpenDP's cryptographically secure random number generator.
}
\details{
Uses OpenDP's Gaussian mechanism to generate cryptographically secure
noise samples, then reshapes to match the input tensor.
