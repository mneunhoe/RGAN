\title{Save a Trained GAN}
\usage{
save_gan(trained_gan, path, include_optimizers = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{trained_gan}{A trained GAN object of class "trained_RGAN" returned by \code{\link{gan_trainer}}}

\item{path}{The base file path for saving (without extension). Files will be created with suffixes.}

\item{include_optimizers}{Whether to include optimizer states for resuming training. Defaults to TRUE.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the base path where the model was saved
}
\description{
Saves a trained GAN model to disk, including the generator,
discriminator, optimizers, and all training settings. The model can be
restored later using \code{\link{load_gan}}.

The function creates multiple files with the given path as base name:
\itemize{
\item \code{path_generator.pt} - Generator network weights
\item \code{path_discriminator.pt} - Discriminator network weights
\item \code{path_metadata.rds} - Settings, losses, and metadata
\item \code{path_g_optim.pt} - Generator optimizer state (if include_optimizers=TRUE
\item \code{path_d_optim.pt} - Discriminator optimizer state (if include_optimizers=TRUE)
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Train a GAN
data <- sample_toydata()
transformer <- data_transformer$new()
transformer$fit(data)
transformed_data <- transformer$transform(data)
trained_gan <- gan_trainer(transformed_data, epochs = 10)

# Save the trained GAN
save_gan(trained_gan, "my_gan_model")

# Load it back later
loaded_gan <- load_gan("my_gan_model")
}
}
