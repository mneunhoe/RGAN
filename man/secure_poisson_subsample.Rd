\title{Secure Poisson Subsampling using OpenDP}
\usage{
secure_poisson_subsample(n_samples, sampling_rate)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_samples}{Total number of samples in the dataset}

\item{sampling_rate}{Probability of including each sample}
}
\value{
Integer vector of selected indices
}
\description{
Sample indices for a mini-batch using Poisson subsampling with
cryptographically secure random numbers from OpenDP.
}
\details{
Implements Poisson subsampling where each record is included independently
with probability q = sampling_rate. This is required for standard DP-SGD
privacy analysis (privacy amplification by subsampling).

Uses OpenDP's cryptographically secure Gaussian mechanism to generate
secure random numbers, then transforms to uniform via the CDF.
